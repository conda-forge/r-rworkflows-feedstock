  summary: Reproducibility is essential to the progress of research, yet achieving it remains
    elusive even in computational fields. Continuous Integration (CI) platforms offer
    a powerful way to launch automated workflows to check and document code, but often
    require considerable time, effort, and technical expertise to setup. We therefore
    developed the rworkflows suite to make robust CI workflows easy and freely accessible
    to all R package developers. rworkflows consists of 1) a CRAN/Bioconductor-compatible
    R package template, 2) an R package to quickly implement a standardised workflow,
    and 3) a centrally maintained GitHub Action.
